# Titanic-Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to handle missing values effectively and prepare the data for machine learning models. The dataset provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Handle missing values in the dataset.
- Visualize trends in passenger demographics and survival rates.

## Key Features
1. **Missing Value Treatment**:
   - Used techniques such as mean, median, and mode imputation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized survival rates by age, gender, and class.
   - Analyzed the correlation between different features.

## Results
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset for further analysis.
- Visualized key survival trends based on passenger characteristics.
